Sorry, I just now saw this. 
 
The last six lines are for calculating the temperature in degrees Celsius, where xx is the reading for the temperature in Hz.
 
To calculate the moisture percentage RH(%) you need to do the following:
 
1.) Two inputs, frequency readings for moisture and temperature in Hz (x' and xx, respectively)
2.) calculate  boundary lines, y_0 and y_100 using temperature in Hz for each sensor individually
3.) calculate the slope as 100/(y_100-y_)  (This value should be negative)
4.) calculate the intercept for your equation y'=m'x'+b' by the following equation: b'= -slope*y_0 (should be positive)
5.) Combine results of m', b' in y'=m'x'+b', where x' is the reading of moisture in Hz and y' is the RH(%)
 
Hope that helps, let me know if you run into any trouble.

Jeff,
I'm assuming all I need is the last six lines of the file you attached?

Markus, 

I've attached the formulas for the four sensors that work. GitHub is still being problematic, so I went ahead and emailed it to you. Hopefully, the instructions are straight-forward enough
